# Data_Analysis_Projects
This repo contains data analysis projects using datasets from `kaggle`. 
The links to these datasets can be found in the notebooks.

Goal of each project is to answer a set of questions defined at the begining of each Notebook and elicit the right decision after stategic analysis of the data.

`Python` is used for data analysis.
