# Data Analysis Projects
This repo contains data analysis projects using datasets from ![Kaggle](http://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white). 
The links to these datasets can be found in the notebooks.

Goal of each project is to answer a set of questions to elicit the right decision after stategic analysis of the data.
